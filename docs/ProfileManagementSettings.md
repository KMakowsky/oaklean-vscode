# Profile Management Settings Page

The profile management feature allows users to create, edit, and switch between different profiles. Each profile can be individually customized to focus on specific aspects of code analysis and optimization.

**Customizable Code Analysis:** By creating specific profiles, the code can be analyzed in different ways, depending on the selected metrics. This allows for precise addressing of performance issues and resource usage.

**Visualization of Optimization Areas:** Profiles can be configured with specific colors to visually highlight areas in the code that need optimization.

**Efficient Resource Management:** The ability to use different profiles for different test scenarios helps developers understand how different parts of the code consume resources.

**User-Friendliness and Productivity Increase:** The quick switching between predefined profiles makes it easier for developers to test and implement different optimization strategies without having to manually change settings. This saves time and increases productivity.
